    <h1>Restorative Yoga</h1>
    <p>Enter a sanctuary of calm and rejuvenation with our Restorative Yoga Class. This deeply relaxing practice focuses on slowing down and opening your body through passive stretching, using props like blankets, bolsters, and blocks to support each pose and enhance your comfort.
        What to Expect:
        Long-Held Poses: Experience deeply soothing postures that are held for extended periods (5-20 minutes) to allow for complete relaxation and release. Each pose is carefully supported with props to ensure that your body is fully comfortable, encouraging a gentle yet profound stretch.
        Gentle Movements: Begin with a few gentle movements to ease into the session, followed by supported poses that are designed to restore and rejuvenate your body and mind. This slow pace helps to calm the nervous system and promote a state of deep rest.
        Focus on Breath: Emphasize slow, mindful breathing techniques to deepen your relaxation and enhance the restorative effects of the practice. The breath acts as a bridge to tranquility, helping to release tension and foster a sense of inner peace.
        Guided Relaxation: Conclude with a guided relaxation or meditation, allowing your body and mind to fully absorb the benefits of the practice. This time is dedicated to nurturing your well-being and cultivating a profound sense of stillness and ease.
